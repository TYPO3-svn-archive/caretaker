Caretaker Installation Tutorial

Setup Caretaker Base System

Step 1 : Get TYPO3 up and running

You are about to install a TYPO3 Monitoring System. I really hope you know how to setup TYPO3. The only thing you probably want to know is that caretaker does not run under php4. So go for php5.

Step 2 : Install the Prerequisites (tt_address and css_styled_content)

Before installing caretaker you have to install the TYPO3-Extensions css_styled_content (For content display) and tt_address for the management of notifications. 

Step 3: Install Extension Caretaker (Checkout from SVN)

Step 4: Create a Sysfolder for the caretaker Records

Step 5: Create some Records to configure Caretaker

- Instances 
 
An Instance represents a monitored TYPO3-Installation. So you have to add an Instance Record for each Site you want to monitor. You have to fill in the url and the ip address or the hostname of the instance. Optionaly you can manage your instances by grouping (instancegroups).

- Tests 

- Testgroups (optional)
- Instancegroups (optional)

- Create Tests (Create -> set Type -> set Configuration )
  - Test Interval
