	* Added seperate extension-skelettons for selenium- and snmp-tests.
 	* Simplified the TestServiceInterface. Now only the method runTest has to be provided.
	* Refactored the db to assign tests and instances to groups. no more tests per instance. This will make the implementation of the testrunner much easier.
    * Removed dependency to tt_address and caretaker instance.
	* Moved Basic test Services to caretaker Instance Extension.
